Notes
=====

This are talking points based on questions that have come from presentations
about DIBS:

+ DIBS requires a human processes in addition to the software
+ DIBS requires a IIIF server in addition to DIBS
+ DIBS requires an authentication service (e.g. Shibboleth, Apache BasicAuth)
+ DIBS is not about automation
+ DIBS is about providing access to materials via a standard viewer using IIIF
+ DIBS, as a CDL implementation, isn't a cost cutting tool
+ DIBS is not intended to reducing staffing requirements
+ DIBS is not used to generate E-Books
+ DIBS is about increasing access to materials which are not otherwise available in electronic form


Other observations
------------------

Adding DRM to digital objects is complex, error prone and generally
doesn't successfully prevent copying. A good example is that most 
cell phones have one or more high resolution of cameras. Most new monitors
are high resolution and increasingly affordable. It is trivial to film a
screen. You can then assemble the images into a PDF of a work or with
additional effort turn that into an E-Book. DRM can't stop that. DRM at
best makes it inconvenient to copy.

Without a download button it is inconvenient to copy IIIF materials where
the source URLs are mitigated by a login and access control.

In the Caltech context the CDL approach made the most sense for resources
that are not currently available for purchase in electronic form but
where there was still demand to circulate the material for research or
instruction without shipping physical copies to patrons. This approach
solved our need for remote course reserve material that was not
available in electronic form for purchase by the library.


Things to track
---------------

The Internet Archive is currently making the case that CDL comes under
existing library sanctioned activity. If this is upheld in the courts
then you may find an increased adoption CDL as well as an increase in
implementations.

For materials that outside of copyright concerns (e.g. material now in
the public domain) the CDL technique may remain a good method of
distributing materials remotely either avoiding or decreasing the need
to copy and ship physical objects.  This could be particularly useful in
the context of historical works and archival material.

In the past Tim O'Reilly of O'Reilly Media undertook a study to evaluate
piracy and the effectiveness of DRM. What he found was that piracy more
often occurred where there was no business relationship with the countries
where the piracy took place. I.e. people pirated O'Reilly books if they
could not buy them or get them from their local library.  When O'Reilly
material was made available through a legitimate channel the piracy
decreased. This suggests that CDL may actually help publishers deal
with piracy related to availability of a work.  When public libraries
were originally introduced in this country (the United States) publishers
where extremely concerned that no one would buy their books if anyone
could read them for free in a public library. In short they feared a
decrease in sales revenue.  What actually happened was the opposite.
Public libraries spread literacy and increased the appetite of the public
to purchase books.
